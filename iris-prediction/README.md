🌸 Iris Flower Classification Project
📌 Project Overview

This project is a Machine Learning classification model built using Python and Scikit-learn.
It predicts the species of an Iris flower based on its features.

The model classifies flowers into three categories:

Iris-setosa

Iris-versicolor

Iris-virginica
